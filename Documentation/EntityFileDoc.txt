EntityFile Documentation:
	EntityFiles contains a list of Entites that can be loaded in the program.
	 Entities are predefined by the EntityList.txt and are loaded into the
	 program at startup.


	As of edition on branch v5:
	>There can be any number of Entities that can be loaded into the program.
	>Entites must be given {Entity_ID}'s that match the {Entity_ID == N + 1}
	 of the EntityFile. You cannot create multiples of the same Entity_ID.

	NOTE: The entire EntityList.txt file list all entities three lines each
	 with no seperating lines. The first line will be the name. The second
	 line will be the stat values. The third line will be the action values.

	Entity text file syntax:
	 Player Entity text file syntax:
	 {Name};
	 {Party_Index}:{Level}:{Health}:{Attack}:{Defense};
	 {Action_value_1}:{Action_value_2}:...{Action_value_(N-1)}:{Action_Value_N}

	Current Action Values available:
    Format: Value "{Action_value}" -> "{Action_name}": {Description}

    Value "1" -> "Strike": Perform basic action using Attack as primary modifier, with
      level and defense as secondary modifier.

    Value "2" -> "Bulward": Amplify defense value using Defense as primary modifier, with
      level as secondary modifier

    Value "3" -> "Cast": TEST_MOVE that matches formula of Value "1". To be changed in the
      future.

    Example content of Player Entity text file:
    Monster
    2:10:100:10:20;
    1:2:3;

    Translation of the text file above:
    EntityName: Monster
    Entity_ID = 2
    Level = 10
    Health = 100
    Attack = 10
    Defense = 20
    ActionSet = {Strike,Bulward,Cast}
