PlayerFile Documentation:
  PlayerFiles contain a set of Entity information that coorelate to
    entities defined by the player within the program. These files
     are primarly created within the program and stored as raw txt
     file to allow modification. 
    
    As of edition on branch v5:
    >Max playerParty entities == 3
    >PlayerFiles are within SaveFile{N} where N represents the index
     value within the "saveFileFolder" vector to list the file as loadable
    >Each SaveFile{N} contains {PlayerEntityName}.txt files which stores
     the information for that specific entity. Note: the name of the 
     {PlayerEntityName}.txt does not have to coorelate with the name
     stored within the text file. 

    Player Entity text file syntax:
     {Name};
     {Party_Index}:{Level}:{Health}:{Attack}:{Defense};
     {Action_value_1}:{Action_value_2}:...{Action_value_(N-1)}:{Action_Value_N}

    NOTE: Within the program, the values input by the user for the health stat
    is multiplied by 10. Example If the player wanted 140hp they would need to
    enter the value 14. 14*10 = 140hp. However, In the text file, this value is stored as a value that can be factored by ten. the value 140 would show up in the text file.

    Current Action Values available:
    Format: Value "{Action_value}" -> "{Action_name}": {Description}

    > Value "1" -> "Strike": Perform basic action using Attack as primary modifier, withlevel and defense as secondary modifier.

    > Value "2" -> "Bulward": Amplify defense value using Defense as primary modifier, with level as secondary modifier

    > Value "3" -> "Cast": TEST_MOVE that matches formula of Value "1". To be changed in the future.

    Example content of Player Entity text file:
    Mesko
    2:10:100:10:20;
    1:2:3;

    Translation of the text file above:
    EntityName: Mesko
    Entity_ID = 2
    Level = 10
    Health = 100
    Attack = 10
    Defense = 20
    ActionSet = {Strike,Bulward,Cast}
